It was a learning project and served the purpose of getting familiar with the transformer architecture.
It was abandoned before it ever properly ran.

Someone with an interest in this specific functionality might have a use for it, but This project was abandoned because it is massive computational overkill to feed thousands of frames into a transformer to classify segments.
