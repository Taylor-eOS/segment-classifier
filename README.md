This was a educational machine learning project that served the purpose of getting familiar with the transformer architecture.
The goal was to classify audio into content types.
Someone with an interest in this specific functionality might have a use for it, but it is massive computational overkill to feed thousands of frames into a transformer to classify audio segments.
