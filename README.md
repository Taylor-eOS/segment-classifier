This was a educational machine learning project that served the purpose of getting familiar with the transformer architecture.
It was abandoned before it ever properly ran.
The goal was to analyze and segment audio into types of content.
Someone with an interest in this specific functionality might have a use for it, but it is massive computational overkill to feed thousands of frames into a transformer to classify segments.
